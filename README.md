# Food_Detection

# Aim and Objectives

# AIM

  To create a Food Detection System which will detect Food and then check healthy or junk food.

# OBJECTIVES

• The main objective of the project is to create a program which can be either run on Jetson nano or any pc with YOLOv5 installed and start detecting using the camera    module on the device.

• Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

• The main objective of this project is to detect food in real-time

# ABSTRACT

• A Quality of food can be detected by the live feed derived from the system’s camera.

• We have completed this project on jetson nano which is a very small computational device.

• A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one  another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

• One such technique is to use YOLOv5 with Roboflow model, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.

• A healthy food may help to prevent certain long-term (chronic) diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Healthy food also help to reduce risk of  developing Various Diseases.

• Eating  Healthy foods that are good for you and staying physically active may help you reach and maintain a healthy weight and improve how you feel.


# INTRODUCTION

• This project is based on a Food detection model with modifications. We are going to implement this project with Machine Learning and this project can be even run on jetson nano which we have done.

• This project can also be used to gather information about Quality of food, i.e., Healthy, Junk food and also Identify food.

• Food can be classified into Healthy and junk, based on the image annotation we give in roboflow it also shows the Name of food.

• In our model of food detection sometimes it becomes difficult to detect food because of Mixing of Healthy and junk foods Togather or various or due to Varieties of Junk and healthy foods.However, training our model with the images of these Mixed foods makes the model more accurate.

• Neural networks and machine learning have been used for these tasks and have obtained good results.

•  Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very useful in pattern recognition and classification, and hence can be used for Floor detection as well.

# LITERATURE REVIEW :

• Eating healthy foods is the cornerstone of good health status and also lower your risk for developing health problems, on the other hand, fast food can have the opposite impact. Several pieces of evidence have revealed that fast food consumption increases the risk of metabolic syndrome by increasing triglyceride levels, triggers blood sugar and blood pressure spikes.

• According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 2.7 million people all over the globe succumb each year due to nutritional deficiency.

• Healthy food refers to a whole lot of fresh and natural products such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and good fats that deliver your body with essential nutrients for carrying out several bodily processes, combat sickness and keep diseases at bay.

• While, junk food is a highly processed food that is made up of ‘empty’ calories foods loaded with full of saturated fat, sugar and devoid of nutrients which neither helps the body to nurture, focus and perform vital functions all through the day. 

• Junk food are highly processed foods loaded with calories, sugar and fat, however, it is devoid of essential nutrients like fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It is believed to be a key factor in the obesity epidemic and a driving force in the development of chronic diseases. Eating Healthy food reduces the chances of getting sick from various diseases.
